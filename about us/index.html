            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <p>The train is the best way to travel in Germany, hands down. Stereotypes about efficiency aside, this rail
                network is one of the most complete in Europe – have a look at our German train map to see just how easy
                it is to get around. Before you know it, you could be waking up in Berlin and tucking into breakfast
                before taking in the Brandenburg Gate, and still be able to take a high-speed train to Frankfurt well in
                time for dinner and a spot of exploring.

                The main train company that manages most of the rail traffic in the country is Deutsche Bahn (DB for
                short) – with them, you can get from major city to major city in no time at all, thanks to the amazing
                high-speed services on offer.

                If you plan to explore large portions of Germany in a short amount of time, we recommend doing it by
                train. Not only will you be able to city-hop like a boss, but you can also even reach other countries in
                under five hours, which is comparable to air travel when taking into account check-in and waiting times.
                For example, you can get from Frankfurt to Paris and from Munich to Vienna in less than four hours on
                the fastest services.</p>

                            <p>Handily, the majority of trains in Germany operate under the banner of Deutsche Bahn, so
                                your brain won’t be too overloaded when looking for the right trains! DB trains can vary
                                from the high-speed Intercity-Express (ICE) models to the slower (though not by much)
                                Intercity and Regional-Express trains.

                                Other trains in Germany include international trains, including DB-SNCF for routes
                                between France and Germany, ÖBB for routes between Austria and Germany, and Thalys for
                                routes between Belgium, the Netherlands and France.</p>

                            <p>German trains represent one of the most effective ways to get around the country –
                                they’re fast, convenient and comfortable. Some of the most popular German train routes
                                include Deutsche Bahn’s Frankfurt to Munich route (which you can do as fast as 3h 10m
                                via ICE train) and FlixTrain’s Berlin to Cologne offering (get there in just 4h 18m).

                            <p>Germany’s ICE trains aren’t just best in class for speed – they’re best-equipped in terms
                                of facilities too. Wondering whether First Class tickets are really worth the extra cash
                                or not? Check out our comparison below for a summary of what’s onboard. Remember, even
                                though ICE trains are generally more expensive than regional and Intercity trains, you
                                may be able to find good deals with us by booking tickets well in advance.
